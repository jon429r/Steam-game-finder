Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.

Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

810740,Turtle Lu,"Mar 22, 2018",20000 - 50000,0,0,2.99,0,"Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another.

Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands.

About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",['English'],[],“Unhappy Ever After is the result of a wicked mind’s imagination!” 8/10 – OPN,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/header.jpg?t=1490429559,,http://warpedtales.weebly.com/,the.warped.tales@gmail.com,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,0,,0,16,10,,0,0,,218,0,218,0,Warped Tales,Warped Tales,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,RPGMaker,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Magic,Dark Comedy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_2633a000f0c52ddd4aaa4f6ba6f92315b72c6b32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_97f13cdc8e0f2efac222d00dcad65c2f9f786a92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_845b2a32cc31afa264587e4bff3dfcb47780a7eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c643f2814b34930b2faae562237dd1336822c024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_1aaae69f2399d3df81056fcfa3ce28dcbff249ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_22f70f34e4a7e39fdb2aa9841748cc7bbb18ac7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_453a0e5bc82e5401a1742d7a955d5a1832a5d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_10a74a79352a5e13607fa2b7c732186d1c67d6e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c81c5b477bc32a9ba0893a796bc7a5ba89ea0633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_47190db23d847f648333e806eeddb925a1b0f4c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_65944ebf80f21df256b8f18b60a1c38deacff9a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_89840d572dbe7c7bb22c7796b0d511c75aaf0fe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_88d55d2249385460a434e802c4f73568dbeca5f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_577784115f5550de311960100799a53cbf92a9de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_4faf9305ca187c787f315a3e1764181cdbfa5a38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_769552b5a36e2d56f3ccb013b155373c0e17f8ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_397be0fa648f76db83662d886f07c4f3de9d679c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_31aa64d32fa7b10b7f94ab51408210825056c842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_0a8a52501655c6e2869376868bc5c7bd7ebc8046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677348/movie_max.mp4?t=1483567252

231330,Deadfall Adventures,"Nov 15, 2013",100000 - 200000,4,0,19.99,0,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976,http://www.deadfall-game.com/,,support@quanticlab.com,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,53,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/deadfall-adventures?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1716,628,,50,1140,,324,0,431,0,The Farm 51,THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"

The Garonne Mercenary Corps, which once resisted the Orc's attack, appeared to be more lonely after the head of the team disappeared. The sudden mission of the Rose broke the daily routine of the mercenary group that survived the struggle. Is it a trap? Still an opportunity? What is hidden behind the royal mission? Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND 异常 very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her. Linasha: The appearance is only 12 years old, but has a age of nearly 30 years old. Unlike the cute and well-behaved appearance, as the main magician of the Garon mercenary group Known as the 'flame elf', she not only has superb magical ability. And the love of mischief, so that the mercenary group of people have a headache. But at the same time, Lina Shah was slightly emotional, and even when she was a little bit of trouble, she even felt pitiful.

If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path.

1557480,Project MIKHAIL: A Muv-Luv War Story,"Nov 1, 2021",20000 - 50000,16,0,19.99,0,"-It’s Your Responsibility to Change the World- Set on an Earth where mankind is being steadily annihilated by the alien invaders known as the BETA. Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that’s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player’s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they’ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player’s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factions’ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future we’ll be adding: ・More TSFs to fight in. ・Voice chat ・Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/header.jpg?t=1652940346,https://www.project-mikhail.com,https://project-mikhail.com/en/support/,support-mikhail-en@ancr.jp,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,328,253,,0,563,,670,0,670,0,"aNCHOR Inc.,fuzz, Inc.",aNCHOR Inc.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Anime,Mechs,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Sci-fi,Simulation,Dark,Robots,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,RPG,Action,Third Person,Adventure,Tactical,Swordplay,Spectacle fighter,Early Access,PvP,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_99d86dcae78e23378dc1a5da0a65abf3a472e09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9d4c4aa8936728fba70562df891b3f173b1a6428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_8019583ecbf9fa9ce1f0d6e43623e5c8cb507475.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9cc13a574d7a0286f74195c6610fa4b41e9a28c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_0a3840381970cb1d9487d8024a477d106fe5b31f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_7c4620218a3c3ce260bb5300578d30343a29c8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_1a9482cae60ddc8ada6a7f343666a661b401bc8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_960b58bb69e087c8b558c668fc4c7a2cc3aa1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_07439c6cc1ad6a558a1510dc74ab0673e989f2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_003cc058eea0de30292c8fb6029d8fee137441d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_e653d2d90e5b13bee943cc2cd3f9aa8e981b4111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256847596/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361467,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858534/movie_max.mp4?t=1635832857,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857340/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361475"
1128520,Rezist: Tower Defense,"Sep 26, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system — your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/header.jpg?t=1589792761,,,hydrargyrum2.0@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,8,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,SparkGames,SparkGames,Single-player,"Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_4be639c00f5f0aebe2af86ee8c5b45f6a8f674a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_016c6384567bc24e253133bcb075416e92c69ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_2d1b02e13cf6056b6413f82346bdedc6263ab9d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_e587cf3a36df2bbbfcec630d44921ad0ba3f4bbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_c5d0e1447b631236160fe332bbecb23b2b91fed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_52dc9d15a04744562d88298b5e9eec9caec62f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_717b8e12f40a7cb4b4e9613b19d4f15aa60fddb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760113/movie_max.mp4?t=1567602189

Master and summon 15 different spirits with unique abilities. 15+ hours of story and gameplay. SUMMARY In a regional city in the present day, Sayaka Mimuro manages her family's Shinto shrine on behalf of her absent parents. Along with her childhood friend Haru and a talking furball (rabbit?) god, she lives a peaceful life, but when an earthquake strikes, aggressive spirits suddenly appear and her world is torn apart. Sayaka receives divine tidings that the only one who can save the city is herself—she's actually an Onmyoji with the power to vanquish spirits! However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man... '...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!' Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight... 'There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?' With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals. With his help, Sayaka finally unlocks her battle-princess powers to wage war on the spirits that ravage her city... CHARACTER Heroine: Sayaka Mimuro Voice: Yui Sakakibara “Nothing is impossible if you give it your all.” A hardworking and beautiful girl with a strong sense of justice. Although Sayaka herself doesn't know it, she's descended from a line of Onmyoji sorcerers, and the powers of exorcism slumber within her. She was brought up to be responsible, and she'll never abandon anyone in need. She also tries to see the best in every situation—even the bad one that her dutiful nature has gotten her into now. When it comes to love, she has as much of an interest as anyone else, but the shrine work she does in her parents' stead has always kept her too busy to date.

Good-Knight is a Butt-clenching Arcade Metal Game influenced by games like Super-Hexagon, Castlevania, and Touhou. It's almost genre-less as it fuses genres like Shooters Rhythm Puzzle Bullet-Hell. Game Play You only need one button because you only have one job- survive from the bullet hell! Use the arrow key or joystick to aim your attack.

Mixed culture: Philippine horrors, history and literature fuse with Greek stories “You got a reverse Centaur (a man with a head of a horse) called Tikbalang, a Smoking treeman who smokes so much, that creates fog so people get lost in the mountains, and the Aswang which is a traditional Vampire but with a twist where it dislocates its lower body and flies away looking for victims at night.” -Zaid Al-Shaheed, co-founder of Team Good Knight Experience the blockbuster visual and audio enjoyment -Atmosphere rendering inspired by Devil May Cry and Castlevania . -Multiple camera angles: automatically angle switch follows game progress. -Original metal soundtrack. -Plus your neat game control! Invite your friends to play with you! Online or in-person.

457140,Oxygen Not Included,"Jul 30, 2019",2000000 - 5000000,7507,0,24.99,2,"In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency.

Also included in the Early Access is a score attack mode- a one minute multiball thriller with increased mission and slot payouts (and each mode has its own separate online leaderboard system)! Super Vixel Land - A retro themed pixel/voxel super wide table that has missions on both the upper playfield and a lower playfield that has a revolving wheel! Slot Shots Casino - A fantasy themed casino playground that features a fully functional slot machine, which has a total of ten payouts based on your slot machine roll. This table also has a spinning lucky wheel in the back that grants various different awards based on where the ball drops down the wheel! Bass Hunter - A fishing themed table that also features its own custom slot machine. In Bass Hunter you will be completing fishing themed missions, such as catching the 'legendary' fish, while also collecting high scores from activating the slot machine that features different fish and tackle. Neon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. Outergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. PLEASE NOTE: This title is built on the Unity engine and there is a slight delay while playing if you use BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. The entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. Features full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. What do the Steam curators have to say about this title? Check it out!

396640,TowerClimb,"Sep 22, 2015",0 - 20000,0,0,14.99,1,"TowerClimb is a difficult and rewarding procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements. TowerClimb is set in a fantasy world where enormous and mysterious towers of ancient unknown origin stand above humanity, extending to the heavens. Humans are driven by curiosity to climb them, usually dying in the process. Struggle forward as a weak human, driven by an iron will to reach the top. The game borrows elements from the roguelike genre. A different adventure awaits each man; you will never play the same exact level twice. Run, Climb, Jump, Swim, and Fly your way up the tower's atmospheric and lethal worlds, using items and resources you find along your way. Quick thinking and strategy will keep you alive as you navigate the tower using unique platforming mechanics. TowerClimb is challenging, and rewards reflexes, skill, knowledge and problem solving ability. Quite often, The tower throws your character into dangerous situations which require you to think very carefully about your actions. A unique, randomly generated level system ensures players must always come up with interesting ways to complete a level. Hundreds of men will die before you posses enough skill and knowledge to conquer the tower. A screenshot of every man's death is saved, along with how he died, to track each and every attempt. TowerClimb at its core is an adventure platformer, with procedural levels and elements based on the rogue-like genre. It features local multiplayer support with an option for split-screen/single-screen. (a maximum of 25 simultaneous players is the limit. However, the game only supports 4 controllers (Xinput limitation). The remaining players must use the keyboard. A program like Xpadder can remap additional directinput controllers to keyboard keys) The game features a TON of content. The Tower is tall and daunting to conquer, with plenty of areas and secrets throughout the game. Getting/seeing everything will take players a long time. There's bonus modes to unlock and play on top of the main game as well. Each time you play the game, everything changes. The levels are different, random events can occur, rare items can be found, etc. The game will always keep you on your feet and give you refreshing challenges and experiences. The platforming mechanics in the game are set up to feel very tight and responsive in combination with the climbing mechanics. You always need to be on your feet and aware of your surroundings, while continually planning how to climb higher. As you progress higher, different worlds introduce new mechanics that mean your play style must evolve. 5 years in the making, by Davioware and Quazi, a team of two brothers who have been developing and playing games since childhood.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/header.jpg?t=1452807494,http://www.davioware.com,http://www.davioware.com/forum/,davioware@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,288,28,,0,228,,53,0,53,0,Davioware and Quazi,Davioware and Quazi,"Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Partial Controller Support,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Indie,Action Roguelike,Action,Adventure,Rogue-lite,Pixel Graphics,RPG,Platformer,Difficult,Procedural Generation,Great Soundtrack,2D,Rogue-like,Local Co-Op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e31dc45661bba44a4fd063bc6ed4799411b265e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3b1f72b79430b6935a6eebfd76bbcd681c443a3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_336a61fdfb2111120c4048bc8df5416ea8dcf1b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_85ebb18e02ec298a7c2a09a955e95dbe9a3d67e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e7fea8248e4e93d034328bae62e45c125f31ed03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_421e546bb493472bd837fc1c22d69b57e576f208.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3c2415648682479e48182a8ed9296b1d1c1677c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_ae90957dd60a4ca02567a9a1e78683c2e4b45263.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_372fb5385d3f89623527898701cf2f52b842ce07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_7ab682072d7e925760570a060e14ec340dee666d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_c099acfcb0acf6089635b6406678bd14d0a326f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_2ee449eb319952219dcbf40c1ece4a341ed9ed22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656588/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378175

695420,Hex: Origins,"Sep 23, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,1.99,0,"Hex: Origins is a casual puzzle game based on a complete hexagon themed colorful experience. Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a  thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards. Complete in-game quests that range from easy to hard and get awesome rewards! Open treasure chests and reap the rewards while you complete any level! Unlock custom hex piece skins. Customize your board with that extra bling! Customize the game experience with 9 beautiful backgrounds!

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/,support@koeitecmo.co.uk,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,3075,6009,,44,5946,,215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

Keep hitting the runes perfectly to accumulate combo energy in your hammers, and you will be able to activate a speed boost! Viking music: The tracklist is curated with love and care. Unleash the drummer in you and play to the epic rock and metal tracks of Alestorm, Gloryhammer, Saltatio Mortis, Wind Rose and many more. All have a festive viking/celtic/pirate style, which will make you feel the viking power in you! Simple gameplay: Following the tradition of arcade games, Ragnarock is easy to play, hard to master. To move forward, only your sense of rhythm matters. However, to win the race, you will have to train and use your skills wisely. Multiple difficulty settings will help you improve over time. Only the most experienced players will be able to collect all the gold medals, beat the high scores and sign their name on the leaderboard! Cross-platform multiplayer mode: The multiplayer PvP mode brings real-time competition against your friends or other people. Start a public or private game (up to 6 players) and beat them all to finish in first place! In solo, you can also race against ghost ships (representing your best score or other players from the leaderboard) to add some competition. Mythological environments: Ragnarock transports you to the land of the vikings in stylized environments inspired by nordic mythology.

To stop the evil, you’ll need a focused team and perfect execution, with a single session lasting up to an hour. CAN YOU BANISH EVIL TOGETHER? Each themed DEVOUR map not only brings a terrifying new manifestation of the goat demon Azazel, but also completely new environments to explore, items to collect, fiends to overcome, and forbidden rituals to perform. Exorcise the demonically possessed Your goal is to break Azazel's hold on the cultists. On each map, work together in a race against time to find key ritual items – some of which might be alive and unwilling - to complete the banishment. Escalating difficulty Each possessed cultist’s rage and speed increases as the game progresses, as does the number of fiends they spawn to stop you. Your only means of defence is your UV flashlight. Replayability Locked doors, ritual objects and item spawns are randomized, ensuring that no two games are the same. What's more, DEVOUR's unpredictable AI ups the game, making you second guess each and every move.

1087620,Life In Yima / 依玛村生活,"Apr 5, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,"Life In Yima is a pixel platform indie ARPG game made by a single lonely indie developer. This game is filled with rich main and side stories, several mini-games. It also features: - Dynamic day-night cycle, which takes an important place in the game mechanic. - Calendar system: the game records the story of Yima village between April and September. - Character development: Fighting monsters, Learning skills, Upgrading character levels and weapons, a simplified RPG experience. - NPC reputation: improving NPCs’ reputations by giving gifts and spending time with them to unlock side stories. The production team led by the leader of the team – Baohua, comes to build a new village in the deep forest and accidentally find a lost person of unknown origin, the MC – Mayi. After deciding to take Mayi with the team, Mayi witnesses the process of the village from nothing to something as a helper. From the beginning to the end, the appearance of the village will be changed drastically! There is plenty of time for the game, and Mayi is also a favored one, and does not need to worry particularly about the difficulty of this game - even if she is inadvertently defeated in battle, it does not mean that the game has failed, and Mayi can even return to the game in a stronger form. (Even skipping time directly to the plot point is possible under certain situations!) Not only the main stories that must happen at a certain point in time, you can also unlock NPC’s side stories by improving their reputations, along with nearly 30 CGs.

1547580,Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Extra Regrets For The Future,"Sep 30, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,9.99,3,"About This Game This predominantly kinetic visual novel has two to three hours of gameplay for the main story and fifteen minutes for each secret scene. Whilst it would be advantageous to have played ' Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Regrets For The Future ', this episode can be enjoyed on its own. Not all characters are 18 or over. The Story Grendel Jinx : A lazy, megalomaniacal kleptomaniac Five years ago, she nearly suffered a fatal and self-inflicted accident during a school outing, saved only by the protagonist's fortuitous presence. After rescuing her, the protagonist is promptly coerced into signing a 'Friendship Agreement' form - a document designed to tie the protagonist to Grendel, both personally and financially, and then ultimately for the protagonist to join Grendel's organisation. With the arrival of the last day of term, Grendel needs to hand in her remaining homework or face the prospect of repeating a year. Drafting in the protagonist to solve her problem, Grendel is annoyed when her demands are swiftly rebuffed. Initiating a devious plan to ensure her education can progress without interruption, Grendel's actions soon attract her mother's attention, who has her own nefarious plans for the protagonist. Features By popular demand, CG graphics have now been introduced to enhance the gameplay. Funny and dramatic SHORT story. Gender selection, with gender-specific dialogue at various points in the game. Seven extra stories are available once the main story has been completed : ' Far Too Good For Us ' : Find out why the protagonist ended up in an upgraded broom cupboard (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Thine ' : A parcel arrives for the protagonist. Naturally, Grendel decides to open it (Part I) (accessed from the title screen). ' The Alien From Somewhere Out There ' : Grendel watches an age-inappropriate film (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Within ' : Emily is looking for something (part of the main story). ' Return to Castle Grendel ' : Grendel's classroom story continues (accessed from the title screen). ' We Want Information ' : ??? (part of the main story). ' High Jinx or Bye Jinx ' : The protagonist is a contestant in a gameshow (accessed from the title screen). Internal and Steam achievements (as per usual). Visual impairment settings, a background and CG gallery, and a music player. Both galleries are only available once the main story has been completed. Path and sound notification. Features the musical talents of Jessica Jenks. Genre : Comedy, drama, action. Romance : None (unless you count Grendels love of causing the protagonist problems). Recently signed Grendel's ' Friendship Document ' (more out of pity than anything else). Doesn't realise what exactly that entails. Whenever Grendel gets behind on homework, she takes the easy way out : Force someone to write everything up. With the protagonist now Grendel's 'Best Friend', what better way of starting this friendship than forcing the protagonist to deal with sixteen different assignments ? Miss Potts is Grendels teacher. She dislikes violence. The protagonists current boss. Soon to be the protagonists' secretary and general dogsbody. Absolutely nothing can go wrong there. Wanting nothing more than their daughter to take over the world, the best way of achieving this is through relentless indoctrination and... ultra-violent anime programs.

572330,The Fan,"May 10, 2017",0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,"The Fan is an interactive photo fiction with real locations and actors. Follow the story of 'The Fan', a serial killer abducting women to fulfill his dark fantasies. His latest catch lies in his basement but she's not ready yet. Everything needs to be perfect for the ritual, when he'll show her 'True love'. The fan is a first person exploration game with a unique twist. Driven by a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, it will take you deep within the darkest places of Paris underground. Gameplay The Fan is entirely made with photos . It has a classic 'point and click' feel, using only left and right click but it's closer to the recent Telltale Game series than to traditional adventures games. There are no painful mini-games or artificially inserted sliding puzzles as it is more about discovery and choices. Find out more about the Killer and his victims as the story unfolds and you may be the one to ultimately decide their fate. WARNING : The game isn't rated yet but I wouldn't recommend if if you're under 16, due to the themes and some violent sequences. More About Me My name is Cyril and I'm a Frenchie indie game dev. The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough. So please, tell me what you think! Feel free to contact me directly if you have any question or comment, I'll be happy to answer!","['English', 'French']","['English', 'French']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/header.jpg?t=1593004829,http://thefan-game.blogspot.fr/p/about-thefan.html,http://thefan-game.blogspot.fr/p/about-thefan.html,cyril.danon@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,72,43,,0,0,,11,0,11,0,Ezhaac Studio,Plug In Digital,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards",Adventure,"Violent,Adventure,FMV,Point & Click","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_fa468acb606b49f742ca71af638208be4d98e237.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_a3ebd7ad69ae9fa5977897da6b2d79e28c9c1e16.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_0f69a0d17d57d6bfb74b855c5f716970eead8ea3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_e6d0da1e520f6cc3795fcae23bcaf38d97c43469.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_a7272a2201aae4570ec7688ddc67f8fd140b9736.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_f0152026f2310ad74f3f4210d92a364c48b01bf6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_710ae5b32f086cc50cd639b42ea42f9495395d90.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_75707ab66d87213beb3819c4d03966d081ac9288.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_91c3a15f59717398882f260edf57f7a20638584b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_79156d65d61f05d49efb4320de2597f06675dc36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256679070/movie_max.mp4?t=1494411412,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256679071/movie_max.mp4?t=1494411421"

926140,CHANGE: A Homeless Survival Experience,"May 1, 2020",100000 - 200000,15,0,14.99,1,"CHANGE is an emotional homeless survival experience set in a randomly generated city with rogue-like elements. Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. So far, we've raised over £7000 for the charities CRISIS, The Clocktower Sanctuary and Shelter. Join us in the community section to discuss the game with the team! We're always listening and awaiting your feedback.","['English', 'German', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],"“With this rich, emotional overlay, coupled with some deep, appealing mechanics, CHANGE is an enthralling survival experience from start to finish.” New Game Network “Change is a gritty, hand-crafted, labor of love that transcends its simple, pixilated aesthetic.

739720,Penkura,"Dec 19, 2018",0 - 20000,1,0,9.99,0,"Penkura combines the wonderful worlds of real-time strategy and first-person exploration. Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura’s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you’ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together. Deep beneath Antarctic ice, a Polish research team discovered an ancient temple that appeared to be a gateway to a fascinating new world.  The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was a blessing for an overpopulated and devastated Earth. Project 'Gemini' was launched to colonize the new world. For 41 years, brave men and women traveled through the temple’s singularity. But one day, for reasons unknown, contact with the other side was severed. To learn what had happened in the world beyond, a group of mercenaries was tasked with traveling through the unstable gateway. You are one of those mercenaries.

As such, Minds Eyes uses many elements that should not normally be combined in a proper horror game. None the less, through all of your feedback, videos and discussions, I was able to transform all of the successes and failures into my subsequent titles: A Girls Fabric Face and Suit 776. To that, I thank you all! :)) Minds Eyes brings you to a world of dreams. You wake up from your slumber to constantly discover you are still asleep. You venture throughout your own home as well as some pieces of your imagination to discover who or what is keeping you at sleep. Will you ever wake up? will you ever finish the journey? Venture through tense full moments of a chilling and nerve wrecking atmosphere that will keep you wondering 'When will something happen!'. Interact with the game and collect game objects which will overall affect your score in the end. Can you locate all game items?, can you make it without a single death? Check what the mind has in store. NOTE: This game is to be played with a single sitting. The estimated game time is 30-45min. This game also includes flashing lights. If flashing lights affect any of your medical conditions, please avoid the game. **SO! what is Minds Eyes really? think of it as an experiment. I have developed Minds Eyes to experiment with new mechanics, features, animations, interactions, and more. Ultimately, I am using this game to gather information in order to build my ultimate horror experience. Think of it as research and development!. I will be watching a large portion of videos that you all send out to me, and note what was good and bad. With that said, If possible, please give me a full on review of the game. Tell me what you likes, disliked and/or would change. This will ultimately let me know what to, and what not to include in future projects.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/header.jpg?t=1569810949,,,Stash329@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,1078,440,,0,0,,30,0,31,0,Stanislaw Truchowski,TurnVex,Single-player,"Action,Adventure,Free to Play,Indie","Horror,Free to Play,Multiplayer,Action,Survival Horror,Adventure,Indie,Thriller,Psychological Horror,Singleplayer,First-Person,Co-op,Experimental,FPS,Online Co-Op,Anime,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_4435487ee1186386e7f84e016dc7263feea0aa58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_6a433732398231d599984f5bb51441f33475e1c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_db38c8e2b9c2570dc19f6313d338ec3bd8797f82.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_fada7355c88bf4557d8ac895a8bd0682dcd2c899.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_402dd626c12ff2d97a539f662c5b6a3b84109014.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_4864ecf8491367c1b8dd73b419037c9ffd5feaa9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949",

To make the world one of his own design, he aims to steal a certain magical necklace that has lost it's potency in the modern age. However, 1000 years ago, it had the capability of summoning extremely powerful demons. The era that Aizack needs to visit coincides with the emergence of Gorgos, which was a dark moment in history.

748490,The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II,"Feb 14, 2018",50000 - 100000,91,13,39.99,13,"Peace is but a memory. In the wake of the Noble Faction’s occupation of Heimdallr, civil war has broken out across Erebonia. The provincial armies, loyal to the aristocracy and the Four Great Houses, have claimed many of the nation’s great cities in the name of the Noble Alliance. The Imperial Army, called back from the four corners of the Empire, has only just begun its sweeping counterattack. After Rean managed to escape Trista with Celine and Valimar, he awakens in the mountains near his hometown uncertain what fate befell his friends, who bravely threw themselves in harm’s way to buy him time to flee. Though the road will not be an easy one, Rean decides to take up his sword again, journeying across Erebonia with his Divine Knight, Valimar, in search of his friends from Class VII and a way to end the conflict before its price becomes far too dear… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II in Japanese) is a direct sequel to Trails of Cold Steel, picking up one month after the decisive collision that changed the fate of the entire nation of Erebonia. The speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system returns with all the bells and whistles together with the new Overdrive mode, new means of transportation both across the land and sky, new allies, new dangers, and a renewed sense of hope as Rean tirelessly works to right the wrongs that have led the country to disarray. KEY FEATURES A Direct Sequel that Remembers the Past Clear data from Trails of Cold Steel carries over into Trails of Cold Steel II, granting players bonuses, and most importantly, remembering the many relationships cultivated during time spent at Thors Military Academy, allowing for more personalized conversations throughout the story. Take to the Land and Sky in New Modes of Transportation Fast travel isn’t just for Trista anymore; a personalized airship now allows players to swiftly choose and descend upon both familiar and foreign destinations alike—and on land, horseback riding not only returns, but players can now customize and utilize Angelica’s orbal bike for fast transportation across the map. The Link System Returns with a new Overdrive Mode Bonding with allies continues to pay off with the Combat Link System, netting a variety of combat benefits including healing, guarding, and more, and the new Overdrive mode allows linked characters to attack up to three turns in a row for new strategic battle options. Experience the Game as Never Before 50% more lines of English voice-overs have been added to the PC release, bringing a fresh experience to even those who have played it before on console. New features for this release include ultrawide aspect ratio support, turbo mode, and an instant resume feature that allows players to launch directly from Steam to their most recent save.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/header.jpg?t=1624575761,http://www.trailsofcoldsteel.com/cs2/,,support@xseedgames.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,81,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,2113,125,,51,1992,,4495,0,8126,0,Nihon Falcom,"XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards",RPG,"JRPG,RPG,Anime,Story Rich,Great Soundtrack,Turn-Based,Singleplayer,Mechs,Fantasy,Romance,Turn-Based Combat,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_6dea04af73ae5d627709d8c5f4e2915d853ab915.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_19987af42f6d8291e4ca576a164d8889d95d4295.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_9e5559f21b1cc1171a9380fe51f1179922d35ad2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_aee59e52d82c780e2fb858afbded2968f2d46057.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_ae9eb7689f95e1040f02247f1ca53e037809a1af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_17cbcda4f4ab6d5e63682d612aa02b50e014f7a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_35971c69aed991097bba64fb5db2f494851d3717.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_f192cc7fc5f9d9bb44f7f98dc57024c3e3869d10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708880/movie_max.mp4?t=1551805118,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256706454/movie_max.mp4?t=1551805134"

544220,Damage: Sadistic Butchering of Humanity,"Dec 11, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,4.2,0,"THE GAME Damage is a violent but humorous 2D-adventure-shooter based on Amiga cult classic which was originally released in 1996. The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself. LEGACY About Amiga version (1993-1997) The enormous project of making an ideal game of our own started back in 1993. We soon became overly ambitious, and we had no idea of what it took to carry out our plans. But we couldn't give in, just took new challenges to make Damage the best it could be. In 1996 the game was ready and players loved it!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/header.jpg?t=1481453954,http://sadisticbutchering.com,http://sadisticbutchering.com,info@suomi-peli.fi,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,5,13,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Suomi-Peli,Suomi-Peli,Single-player,"Sexual Content,Nudity,Violent,Gore,Action,Adventure,Indie,Early Access","Gore,Nudity,Indie,Sexual Content,Action,Early Access,Violent,Adventure,Dark Humor","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_9db08480c2f425197319f0ca137d7911e5bc63e1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_9608f2a910b64755f6d759f51158238a3c4d5b2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_e271dfa796de9756e345ab9f1b4fc200b1ce99a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_145338cda9be97611bd17d03350ab56b20e694d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_aaf604428ee8743fae6ad84d3ce202accd280efb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256675884/movie_max.mp4?t=1481133083

Meet a variety of NPCs from the different races of the land: THE HETONIANS are intelligent and cunning. They build extravagant cities and castles, and war for land with themselves and the other races, for their greed knows no bounds. THE SKOGEN are a reclusive nature-dwelling people. They worship the Shapers, creators of Talumos, as well as the five true gods of the Moonlight Realm. Their devotion to the preservation of nature often leads to warring with the other races when their land is threatened. THE FORLORN are cursed dragon-like humanoids who live far away in the Skyreach Peaks. Historically shunned and scattered, the Forlorn are resentful of the other races and wait for their warleaders to lead them to glory in battle. THE FALLEN are what happens when the Black Flame, a power from another realm, is used to transform an entire nation. The result is a corrupting and undying sinister legion, led by a mad king, attempting to bring ruin to every living thing in Talumos.

She was a Franco-Spanish painter and a key figure in the pictorial revival that took place in Europe during the First World War. Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'école de Paris, a star and an essential figure of Cubism. She became one of the most important characters of the 20th century avant-garde art. This virtual gallery is intended to pay tribute to the great artist on the 90th anniversary of her death in Paris, and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public. Her new languages and the most advanced techniques are shown in 65 works never seen before. This museum has several rooms marked by key dates in its history, accompanied by a virtual character who, from a few monitors, explains her biography in a playful and didactic way, corresponding to the works exhibited in each space.

Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/header.jpg?t=1478020022,http://pehesse.fr/honey/,,honeyUFE@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,32,9,,37,0,,0,0,0,0,Pehesse,Self,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy,Visual Novel,Female Protagonist,Beat 'em up,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_09e82a595abc068ad4a27e8fad05576f46411d33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_787917ee9afb79fd2bf5d442d46a0b43c43d8bfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_0a67f4a7c2031187b0460de021e0d569f6875983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a6a1bd8104824fad0b9b398ee7fd70242672bd72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_702b0c1e792a0b4f3c7dd43a1bad9193a41a725b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_6b04fc096767209ed2a15412b29b0fef97e0117f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_687a63ca117854407dfc96811f4171dd3e87bad0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_f4b67258f40fb937e28389c2db1a3032a65ffaa8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_bdb4e00f3971ba91b1bde9ba5f56d3db79654e79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_9064fd49444f8e84e60e1aaf04bd9021b3faa733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_e87d876362f4f00f5d6e7d117040144e89d3081c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_94dc8365b330b6edb957e7ebbcb4d59145349848.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a143f73252403c449a1dcee8566351ea3c2621cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_d4421cf7267c3a916f693241d2f80e193427cf9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670193/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458904,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670194/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458916"

Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience. Xpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience. The game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events. Xpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees. Along with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving. The interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games. For the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/header.jpg?t=1639506578,http://www.xpandrally.com,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,82,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/xpand-rally?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,293,73,,0,311,,138,0,138,0,Techland,Techland,"Single-player,Multi-player",Racing,"Racing,Driving,Automobile Sim,Physics,3D,Economy,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Offroad","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000484.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000483.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000485.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000482.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001253.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001254.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001255.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578",

1986310,猎魔战纪,"May 25, 2022",0 - 0,0,0,0.0,1,先声明本游戏战斗有一定难度，并不适合喜欢玩挂机刷刷刷的朋友。 由于并没有太多的测试人员，主要是我自己在测试，即便我玩了很多遍，但难免会有遗漏和不合理的地方。 如果有出现BUG或者大家觉得有某些地方难度不合理，希望大家能积极反馈，评论区留言或者进群@都行！感谢各位赏脸游玩！ 游戏着有不同于其他回合制游戏的战斗机制，每个角色有着独特且能产生质变的天赋加点，你可以把角色按你想的方向上培养。 但是注意你的天赋需要与你主要使用的技能搭配，才能发挥最大效果。 本游戏需要注意的点： 1.很多技能释放需要tp点，我们可以通过加攻速或者加tp回复来提高tp获取效率。 2.技能每次使用会获得熟练度，熟练度可以提升技能等级和伤害，技能熟练度达到要求会解锁更高级技能，所以我们要尽可能多的使用技能，把一个技能练到极致会比每个技能练一会要强得多！ 3.游戏的里控制技能对任何敌人都有效，但部分怪物被控制后会狂暴，狂暴状态下将免疫控制且伤害可能会略微提高。 4.按Q可以快捷保存。 5.设置里面有设置战斗加速，修改窗口样式等功能。 6.更换装备时镶嵌物品会自动转移到新装备上，不需要自己取下来重新镶嵌。 关于战斗： 与其他回合制战斗不同，游戏中有攻速属性。 攻速直接影响角色普通攻击造成伤害的次数，而普通攻击每次造成伤害恢复5点TP，物理系技能是没有冷却时间的只受TP点数的限制，所以攻速也间接的影响了技能的释放频率。 对于敏捷路线的角色，想要提升输出，提升敏捷和攻速是最佳方式。（前提是你的攻击不能太低） 对于力量和智力路线的角色，攻速带来的提升并不明显，所以TP恢复至关重要。很多时候直接增加伤害不如增加TP恢复来的实在！ 关于美术： 刚开始是有想请画师和美工的打算，可是了解了下价格我放弃了…… 整个游戏包括角色立绘、行走图、怪物图片、场景图块、技能特效、UI设计然后一堆图标感觉没个十来万下不来，这让我实在承受不住。 后来想找人已合作的方式给分成，但似乎也不现实，毕竟想找人来免费玩你的游戏都挺困难的…… 所以，只能咬咬牙自己瞎折腾了。游戏的UI素材大部分是RPG make和dlc自带的，也使用了部分其他资源，费劲力气也只能整成现在这样了！ 关于剧情： 作为一个rpg游戏剧情至关重要，但是很遗憾…… 我个人觉得游戏的剧情框架还是不错的，但是受限于自己的文笔和图片素材不足，很多剧情其实都是根据现有图片素材临时编的。 其实游戏中有很多东西没有讲，比如： 1.关于水斗的来历，其实佐克和水斗的父母其实曾经也是猎魔者，后来水斗父母意外死亡，于是佐克退隐照顾主角。 2.夜瞳的父亲其实是十几年前的被星玄打败的将军，整个军队全部战死无一生还。由于莫名其妙的被人团灭，他从受人尊敬的将军变成笑柄，夜瞳和母亲也饱受其他人的嘲笑，夜瞳的母亲也因此郁郁而终，所以长大后夜瞳来到帕拉斯是想弄清楚当年的事，为父亲正名。 3.乌诺斯为啥要打帕拉斯？其实是有人拱火，这个人和故事的幕后黑手麦迪文一样其实都来自的另一个大陆。他们就是想两边拱火，让两国打起来，他们就可以乘机进行实验，制造战斗用的魔物，说白了就是想把这片大陆当成战争实验室。 4.其实后续还有剧情，大致内容是：两国还是打起来了，之后再与夜瞳再见面，却不得不兵戎相见。然后会有新角色出现，阻止了战斗，新角色是另一个大陆的人，他正在调查他们那个大陆的一个邪恶组织，而这场战争就是这个邪恶组织在幕后操纵，目的是乘乱制造出可控制的魔物…… 其实整个剧情有点参考了一部日本动漫《大剑》，这是一部被禁的神作（个人觉得是神作！），至今我的电脑里还有这部动漫的资源，想看的可以加群@我，哈哈哈…… 后续： 虽然这个游戏还有后续剧情，但是暂时不打算出续作，因为我觉得自己目前还没有力能把剩下的故事讲好…… 也许等哪一天时机成熟了，我会回来继续填这个坑，也许…… 之后还是会接着做新的游戏，目前有一些思路，大致是一个策略经营+战棋的游戏。 新游戏的话打算用unity去做，也会花钱去请美工画师，有新进度我也会在群里通知大家，希望大家到时能关注一下。 游戏qq群：634019932 作者b站主页： 头条和西瓜视频：,['Simplified Chinese'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/header.jpg?t=1653818726,,,1245496327@qq.com,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,,0,0,0,,21,0,,0,0,0,0,水狗工作室,水狗工作室,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Free to Play,Indie,RPG",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_71debbd8b2ef0220362d2457c7d436a757452416.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_a55f7799378a715f1a09d0f1865b54f5cf331542.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_6e6dae23ecff4709935a9f7af04ae2043893b4ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_212e0e0e54a3fb01bad00b29ce0742fa9a3a3823.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_5eee828bfaf061ec4aab893177b8517b2f43c421.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_274c26ce4b9d0b6ca184ae25f398f135e1872df5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_74317dd7bf08e20a494b4e2981993df2950b862b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888059/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369874,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888060/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369878,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256885323/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369883,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256885321/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369887"

Play as Aella, a spunky Falkonir, or Horu, the brave Falcon, as you work together to explore a mountain devastated by wild magic and plagued by nightmarish wraiths to put an end to the corruption. On the continent of Myrelin lies a village to the Northwest known as Frostfall. It is here the kingdom, Kingstone, trains the most elite scout units Myrelin has ever seen, the Falkonirs. It is the Falkonir's sworn duty to watch over the lands to protect the kingdom from any encroaching armies or outbursts of wild magic and monsters. On a day like any ordinary, Aella begins training with her falcon, Horu, and her mentor. When suddenly the ground trembles and shakes, and a thunderous crack pierces through the air revealing that Mount Bohlgast has unleashed its stored nightmares. Wraiths begin to manifest and envelop everything in their surroundings. With Aella barely saved by Horu's newfound strength, it is up to the two of them to end whatever wild magic is plaguing their people.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/header.jpg?t=1639625557,,,gdd450.purple@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Fowl Play Studios,Fowl Play Studios,"Multi-player,Co-op,Online Co-op,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_41293048a9416b7343e01809bfd802dc630e7239.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_fc11c43843aa833dd47bf95073c00c7bda79ccbd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_798379276b0c9dd18739480749e1cdb4697f2aa3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_5b63292383837fc0479e59d245f47dcf4b253994.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_97f5bb2a4533f66e16787eb0f6e738cb7189b359.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_3668dd35ea1d32d5a7e045f1335dcafd5b79d17f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_560e2025198531d844acd3ccad72bb6e5eefd0d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_26df6c10a27b15b0989b2d34b6ae791706c2c00f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_ad0454c393398a7b637d1a7f9a82ecfd7e8ba495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_fc4f143dc62215b80347f6c5910c978165c4dbbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_7165f7e1022448d7656e08c0993baf88ee4c107f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_01d991f2613d37bf7206fdf7c36be52f6aa36d36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_9c0ce5d72a8cd182d03dd1d906e2faf34d5b6d41.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1570340/ss_ef08aa043eb79f94811f0e4df721501fc18e0dca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639625557","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256833148/movie_max.mp4?t=1620017249,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256831137/movie_max.mp4?t=1620018348"
304970,SolidFace Parametric CAD Modeler 2D/3D,"Dec 22, 2014",0 - 20000,0,0,0.0,0,"Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation. The parameterization capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing or in 3D sketch module.

And that’s when the real chaos started… April is fixated on earning a Mirage star for the spa and is willing to do anything - and everything - to get one! Sally doggedly insists April isn’t as bad as she looks. I’m sorry, but if it looks like a snake and slithers like a snake, well… Of course, that’s just MY opinion! Please, come help me talk some sense into Sally. With your help, I’m sure it will be okay in the end!

But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life! The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do.

392030,Murasaki,"May 12, 2016",0 - 20000,0,0,4.99,1,"A mystical world on the edge of destruction. Unlikely saviors joined by fate and duty. A mission driven by music, magic...and survival. Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul.","['English', 'Japanese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/header.jpg?t=1578972607,http://katatema.main.jp/mu/,,support@playism.jp,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,85,8,,48,0,,0,0,0,0,Katatema,PLAYISM,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Bullet Hell,Shoot 'Em Up,Anime,Great Soundtrack,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Arcade,2D,Casual,Female Protagonist,Difficult,Fantasy,Controller,Retro,Atmospheric,Colorful,Experimental,Cute","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_4115d58f8cc9da6c994cab98521befed122d0118.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_285723e0ac3ed606a80f42215f7dc2729de3058e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_403dbdfb1fd4dc8c04b4ef9bd04ff3b20eecfc68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c92a966fb2f34bebefafcf328657ae4aa0ce265e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_37412d3ee0e9b2bd10b0113f6be42778f40199c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c7e0d85a7b1624ff9bead15a154ba9d45db55ec6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_42b64c0fd9cacdbc4aa84ce821cd7a0c5e5105f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_d007163a143881a64465a68f319e44ed509f635e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_fbec3bd2fcceadefa58f491ddecc3e2a97fa5f77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256662903/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316502,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660464/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316516"

Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck!

A) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon’s gravity well. B) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he’s so smart. C) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon’s surface instead of attempting a risky escape. D) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd’s screen with a torque wrench. Humanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero?

1588760,Switchball HD - Puzzle Platformer,"May 17, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,2.69,0,"Switchball is an inventive and fun puzzle-driven game based on real world physical interactions. Beautiful and elegant 3D graphics offer panoramic views of 30 incredible levels in 5 amazing worlds. The game puts the player in the role of a marble, which is guided through a narrow winding course suspended in mid-air in five different worlds: Skyworld, Iceworld, Caveworld, Cloudworld and Lavaworld. The marble can be morphed into different balls with unique physical properties, like a Marble Ball, a Power Ball (which can be charged and have an accelerated 'dash', a 'jump' ability or switchable 'magnetism' properties), a Steel Ball (which can push heavy objects around), and so forth. Each course contains obstacles and traps, such as wooden blocks, sheets of cloth, spinning fans, magnets, and cannons. The game uses physics-based puzzles as well, such as moving boxes; also, different balls react to the environment in different ways; Steel Balls, for example, will tear cloth platforms. Each level is timed, and players are rewarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals, depending on how quickly they complete the level. Switchball has received several awards over the years and is now relaunched on Steam as Switchball HD.

924740,Beyond Senses,"Jan 6, 2020",0 - 20000,0,0,7.99,0,"Thousands of writings and books tell of encounters with witches, ghosts, demons and the devil himself. Our world is complex and unexplored. We mostly don't notice anything of all this thanks to secret organizations whose objective is the elimination of paranormal phenomena . In Beyond Senses, you'll slip into the role of either a good hunter or an evil demon. Discover the world Beyond our Senses! Countless features guarantee a varied and unforgettable gaming experience . Beyond Senses can be played by up to 5 players! Beyond Senses is one of those rare multiplayer horror games that offer more than just one game mode! Three game modes are currently available: HUNT , EGOIST and BANISHMENT . Each game mode can be customized to your personal needs. In HUNT , your task is to weaken the wandering creature by charging blessed Energy Crystals and killing it afterwards. The more energy the Crystals receive, the weaker the creature becomes after some time. If the creature is weakened enough, you can kill it with your weapons and send it back to hell! In EGOIST you compete against your fellow players. Your goal is to conquer as many Energy Crystals as possible. Whoever has conquered the fewest Energy Crystals after a certain time will be hunted mercilessly by the wandering creature. You can use a stun gun to put your fellow players out of action for a short time and gain a time advantage. In BANISHMENT you must find all the cursed items and place them properly in a pentagram . Once you have successfully completed the ritual, you must lure the wandering creature into the pentagram to send it back to hell! Evil is all around us. Each location is individually designed and can be played in any game mode . All players should have the opportunity to create the best possible gaming experience for themselves. For this reason, new locations are constantly being added . There are currently 3 different maps available: CEMETERY FOREST HORROR HOUSE If you play as a hunter, you can currently choose between 4 different characters: John Hughes , Lauren Williams , Elijah Knight and Amy King ! As a creature, you currently have the choice between Dr. Walker (ghost) and Valac (demon). Both hunters and monsters have different 'skins', which can change the appearance of the characters. These skins will be unlocked during the course of the game by gaining experience points . From time to time there will be bonus actions or contests in which special skins can be unlocked. More hunters, monsters and skins will be added during the development of the game! So that your gaming experience does not go unrewarded, there is a level system. You start with level 1 and can work your way up to level 30. As you reach new levels, you'll unlock more skins , skills , lamps , weapons , tools and titles . Your experience points are assigned to your account and are not tied to your characters. The higher your current level is, the harder it will be to reach the next level. There is also a suitable subsystem : All tools and skills themselves can reach a higher level and become better through frequent use. Your account data is comfortably and securely stored in the Steam Cloud, so you can access it from other computers at any time! Beyond Senses offers a lot of features that we can't list completely with individual headings here. Therefore, all features of Beyond Senses that haven't been mentioned before are listed in this section: You can carry 2 of currently 4 gadgets with you: Holy Water, Sound Emitter, Incense Bomb, Devil's Trap Currently you can select 1 out of 6 possible light sources: Glowstick, Phone, Hand Lamp, Flashlight, Portable Searchlight, Night Vision At the moment you have 3 different handguns at your disposal: Remorse, Peacemaker, Vanquisher As a Hunter you can use one skill per round: Invisibility, Energy Incantation, Resurrection, Banishment, Teleportation Each Monster has 2 - 3 different skills, which can be used several times per round Currently you can unlock 5 titles: Ghost Hunter, Monster Banisher, Scaredy-Cat, Doll Hater, Living Legend . Titles are (currently) only cosmetic and don't bring any advantages in the game!","['English', 'German', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/header.jpg?t=1589041267,https://www.beyondsensesgame.com/,https://www.pyxtonstudios.com/contact,info@pyxtonstudios.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,22,16,,100,0,"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content.",0,0,0,0,Sky Haubrich,Pyxton Studios,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,LAN PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,LAN Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy","Action,Indie,Strategy,Adventure,Gore,Horror,Multiplayer,Survival,Psychological Horror,First-Person","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_cb0ec1435f248fbe8238ebc43b12da5752d20e7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_7eba728792e5220178ede70d4cb0b65d28363176.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_c6dc5b1b9eb99ee6b3709c6e25dbe6134868625a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_e28ec2d53977e3569aabfa0940685546ee8aea70.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_5b633ca632983c24176646d95d7f76f45c5e79d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_04cf7e5a7ba0a07511f836c7ae02f9b4bfbc80bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_76a97549ff9da0ad62c4ad11188288723ef4b39b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_880a2e3bfb528bbda3c30e43042fd047e1985cf1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_ae9c1451b34efddde1d1941c1e61bde9f173e89e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_8b81715d17c00f197f7111f42eb22b95ae6e9ea3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924740/ss_5938537c71471a6c76f8e7a18067611132fde574.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589041267",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256762707/movie_max.mp4?t=1569491003
